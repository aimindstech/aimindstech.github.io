          <p>With abundance of choice and ease of accessibility of information, on anything and everything in this day and age, any purchase decision has indeed become a lengthy, tiresome process. In the pursuit of looking for the best deal all by ourselves, we spent countless hours of our time without even realizing it.</p>
<p>Say if we are looking to buy a property, most people do all the work of narrowing down the list of properties, visiting the open house all by themselves without involving any agents. Similar attitude applies while travelling to new places - booking flight, hotel, rental car, tourist spots - all of them are undertaken by the individuals who do the travel, eliminating the need for a travel agent in most cases.</p>
<p>i.e. We rely more on algorithms and online tools to provide us the best deals. And this attitude is very much prevalent with a majority of millennials and Gen Z. Over the past 2 decades, B2C (Business-to-Consumer) ecommerce has flourished in a massive, unimaginable way. Current COVID19 situation has only made the B2C marketplace expand into unknown territories.</p>
<p>But there is also a new trend which is catching up with the Business-to-Business marketplace. As millennials step into the role of decision makers in many organizations, they expect all their business purchases to be done at the best possible rate and quality.</p>
<p>Usually business wholesale purchases happen by trust, longevity of the end provider&rsquo;s service, provider&rsquo;s reputation, provider&rsquo;s association with their business in terms of years etc. Traditionally wholesale purchases from a business usually keep going to the same provider and businesses also preferred to maintain status quo because they also did not want to disrupt a working process.</p>
<p>Not anymore. In the pursuit of providing the best deals to the end consumer while also maintaining their profit margin, millennial business leaders are aggressively shopping for the best deals - they could get for any of their bulk purchases. If that means shaking up the status quo supplier, so be it.</p>
<p>This has also led to the emergence and boom of B2B ecommerce. Those startups which provide an online ecommerce platform which enables this marketplace, have turned into billion-dollar valuations. Watch out for this space.</p>
